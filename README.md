# Swiss Electricity Consumption Trends (1980–2022)

![Swiss Electricity Consumption Index (1980 = 100)](assets/dashboard_index_1980_100.png)

*Indexed electricity consumption in Switzerland (1980 = 100) with key macroeconomic events highlighted.*

This project analyses long-term trends in electricity consumption in Switzerland using publicly available national energy statistics.

The core deliverable is an **interactive Databricks dashboard**, allowing exploration of absolute consumption, year-over-year changes, and indexed growth over time.

## 🔗 Interactive Dashboard

👉 **Live Databricks dashboard (public):**  
https://dbc-817d9cb9-9ea8.cloud.databricks.com/dashboardsv3/01f0f2e6aac110c1bde66b026478c652/published?o=7474657422351518

The dashboard includes:
- Interactive tooltips
- Time-series exploration
- Event annotations (financial crisis, COVID-19)
- Multiple analytical perspectives

## 📊 Analytical Views

### 1. Annual Electricity Consumption (TWh)
Shows total electricity consumption in Switzerland from 1980 to 2022.  
Highlights steady growth until the mid-2000s, followed by a prolonged stabilisation phase.

### 2. Electricity Consumption YoY Change (%)
Displays year-over-year percentage changes, capturing short-term volatility and economic shocks such as:
- Global financial crisis (2008–2009)
- COVID-19 pandemic (2020)

### 3. Electricity Consumption Index (1980 = 100)
Normalised index to compare long-term growth independently of absolute units.  
Clearly illustrates structural growth until the mid-2000s and relative stability thereafter.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Swiss electricity consumption increased steadily from 1980 until the mid-2000s, reflecting economic growth and rising electrification.
- A visible slowdown appears around 2008–2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis.
- Since 2010, consumption has largely stabilised, suggesting efficiency gains and structural changes in energy demand.
- The COVID-19 period shows increased volatility rather than a long-term structural decline.
